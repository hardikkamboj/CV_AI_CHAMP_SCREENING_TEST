I also taught some labs on ASP.NET,where I got exposure to JavaScript, HTML, and VB.NET.I worked with wonderful people at RSM, but for my day-to-day job,I found that I was interested in pursuing a more technical positionwhere I could develop models, learn new technologies/codinglanguages, and/or utilize statistics. Because of this, I chose to enrollin an intensive Data Science apprenticeship/course through Thinkfulin order to solidify my technical skills and practice implementingmachine learning models through project work.

This sprouted because Iam mainly interested in how things work the way they work. Forexample: If you give me an algorithm and say that this works for aparticular problem- my first question would be how does it work?What's the idea behind it? Why not some other way? What are thepros and cons of it? What was the approach that is worse than this? This thinking made to be successful as a programmer till now andenhanced my interest in Algorithms.Besides, this interest in reasoning made me to develop curiosity inunderstanding how Machine Learning and Deep learning modelsactually work. What is the model learning at each step? I want toexplore this Blackbox which I think would pave a way to make theDeep learning models better.Apart from being a Computer Science Engineer, I have an immenseinterest in Neuroscience and would love to learn and talk about it.

This project got me interested in MachineLearning. It was very impressive to me that a machine could besmart similar to a person and solve the problem even easier andmore accurately than a human. I decided to expand my knowledgein this field by taking online courses and reading popular booksand blogs. Through these studies, I found that Deep Learning ismuch more powerful. Before I started learning Deep Learning, sinceI knew Python programming language was extremely useful indeep learning because of its simplicity and extensive libraries andframeworks,  I decided to improve my programming skills. ThereforeI took a couple of online courses and used the HackerRank websiteto practice Python practically that I received the 1st rank in that. AfterI was been confident in my Python skills, I started learning DeepLearning by taking an online course and get its certificate. Certainly,this is not the end of my willingness to learn this field, and I haveplans to release my open-source codes and their documents andcreate a deep learning blog to share my experiences and knowledgewith others.ExperienceVirginia Tech1 year 11 monthsGraduate Research AssistantAugust 2020 - Present (1 month)Research ScholarOctober 2018 - August 2020 (1 year 11 months)United StatesIslamic Azad UniversityLecturer  Page 1 of 2mailto:somayeh.yarahmadi@gmail.comhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/somayeh-yarahmadi-357aab5b?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume%3Bsydzwno0Qd2svzHneSOwow%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume-v02_profilehttps://www.linkedin.com/in/somayeh-yarahmadi-357aab5b?jobid=1234&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume%3Bsydzwno0Qd2svzHneSOwow%3D%3D&licu=urn%3Ali%3Acontrol%3Ad_jobs_easyapply_pdfgenresume-v02_profile   January 2013 - August 2015 (2 years 8 months)DoroodPayame Noor University (Distance Education)LecturerAugust 2013 - May 2015 (1 year 10 months)DoroodShahrekord UniversityLecturerJanuary 2011 - May 2013 (2 years 5 months)ShahrekordEducationVirginia TechDoctor of Philosophy - PhD, Electrical and ElectronicsEngineering · (2020 - 2024)UdacityProgramming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree, ComputerScience · (2020 - 2020)UdacityData Analyst Nanodegree, Computer Science · (2020 - 2020)University of Kurdistan, SanandajDoctor of Philosophy - PhD, Electrical and ElectronicsEngineering · (2015 - 2020)Shahrekord UniversityMaster’s Degree  · (2010 - 2012)  Page 2 of 2"
